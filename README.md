# AdvProgramminLab6

This repository contains the code for Lab 6 assignment.The assignment's requirements is to write a Java program that sorts the containers in an ARXML file alphabetically and outputs the result to a new file with a modified name.


## Student Data
Name : Eslam Mohamed Marzouk
Code: 20000252
section : 3


## Requirements

The program should handle several exceptions, including an exception for empty classes and an exception for invalid file names. These exceptions are implemented in the `EmptyAutosarFileException.java` and `NotVaildAutosarFileException.java` files, respectively. I added 2 more exeptions, 'NotExistingAutosarFileException.java' for the non existing file, and 'DefAutosarFileException.java' for arxml files with defected data.


## Usage

To use this program, you will need to have Java installed on your system. You can compile and run the program using the vatch file 'run.bat'. it will test the required 3 cases.
